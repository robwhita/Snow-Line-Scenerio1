<h2>OAuth Demo</h2>

Make sure you have Python version 2.7 installed.  

To run the server application, open a command terminal, and navigate to the folder where you saved this Python script. Replace the required variables (Client ID, Secrect ID etc...), then run:

*python oauth_demo.py*

You should see this in the terminal:

Listening on http://0.0.0.0:10060...

Open http://0.0.0.0:10060 in a browser.

**Note**: Your Redirect_URI in the Integration's settings on Developer Webex Teams site should be: http://0.0.0.0:10060/oauth or if you're using any other hosting platform it would be https://YOUR_SERVER/oauth
